# blender_search-replace

This Add-On introduces a comprehensive tool for searching and replacing objects within the Blender 3D scene. It extends Blender's functionality by allowing users to selectively replace objects with another while optionally preserving the original objects' rotation and scale. It primarily aids in efficient object management within Blender scenes, especially useful in large scenes or during significant modifications. It extends the UI with custom panels and operators, improving workflow by allowing batch replacement of objects with advanced control over properties like rotation and scale.
